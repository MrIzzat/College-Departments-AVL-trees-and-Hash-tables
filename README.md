# College-Departments-AVL-trees-and-Hash-tables
**Important Note:** Requires JavaFX.

Stores departments and students of those departments using AVL trees and Hash tables. The project contains the custom made AVL and Hash data structures used for this project. Also contains custom queues for the AVL tree. Contains binary tree code as well for the AVL.

The GUI is not the best and it was made by hand.

I made this project years ago I honestly forgot the details.
